# PH5500-Dynamical-Systems
simulations performed using Princeton's stdlib for Dynamical Systems course presentation


The .zip file contains most of the existing code for displaying matrix in a canvas. It is slightly modified to my needs (in the percolationio.py program) to include functions that can 
perform real space renormalization procedure for b=2 in a 2D lattice.
